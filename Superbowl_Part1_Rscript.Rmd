## Import Data

In this section, we import the necessary data for this lab.

```{r import, include=FALSE}
### set your working directory
# use setwd to set your working directory

# you can also go to session-> set working directory -> choose directory
# working directory is the path to the folder and not file

# make sure the path of the directory is correct, i.e., where you have stored your data

setwd("C:/Users/sansar13/Documents/mgt585/data")

# Homework Assignment 1: Super Bowl Caselet (Part 1)

You are hired as a Business Analyst to help the manager to find out if spending millions of dollars on Super Bowl ads creates social media buzz.

As a first step, carry out the analysis using DPLYR using superbowl.csv data. There are some questions below that you need to answer.

## Dataset Exploration
```{r explore}

# Use five functions dim(), colnames(), str(), head() and tail() to explore all the superbowl table
# observe different columns of the table and values in the rows
# type your answer below this line



# tell R, new_brand, month and superbowl columns are factor 



# tell R, week_of is date of format "%d-%b-%y"



# you can try and experiment with different date formats here: 
# https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/intermediate-r-for-finance/dates?ex=6


```

## Five Functions of DPLYR

```{r DPLYR Basics}

# Query 1. Filter all rows where new_brand == 'Beetle'
# type your answer below this line



# interpret the results:

################################################################################

# Query 2.Select all the columns related to buzz metrics (volume, positive and negative mentions)
# type your answer below this line



# interpret the results:

################################################################################

# Query 3. Arrange the adspend column in descending order and see which brand has the highest ad spend and in which week_of
# type your answer below this line



# interpret the results:

################################################################################

# Query 4. Create a new column called sentiment which is a sum of positive (column name is pos) and negative (column name is neg) mentions,
# and select only three columns for display, week_of, new_brand and sentiment
# type your answer below this line



# interpret the results:

```
